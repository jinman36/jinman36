### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github. I am learning to code after a career with Special Operations. 
- That role helped me find that I very passionate about working with diverse teams in order to accomplish difficult goals in often fluid environments. I strive for continual improvement and love learning everything I can.

My current coding goals are:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on small projects to get prepared for something bigger!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML 5, CSS, JAvascript, React, Python

**Just learned this trick, so more to come!**
